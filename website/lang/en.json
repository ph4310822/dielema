        "Our smart contract system allows you to designate a successor for your on-chain fortune while maintaining complete control. By periodically submitting a proof of life, you keep your assets active. If the unexpected happens, your assets automatically transfer to your chosen beneficiary.",
        "Built for multi-chain compatibility, Dielema works across BSC, Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, ensuring your digital legacy is protected regardless of which blockchain you use."
